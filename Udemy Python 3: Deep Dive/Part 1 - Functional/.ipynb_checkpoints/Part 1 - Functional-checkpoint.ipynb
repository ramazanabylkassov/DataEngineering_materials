    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"screenshots/variables_are_memory_references_screenshot.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "* id() function returns the memory address of the object in a base-10 number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference counting\n",
    "* is a memory management technique where each object keeps track of the number of references pointing to it. When an object's reference count drops to zero, the associated memory is automatically deallocated, preventing memory leaks and enabling automatic memory management in Python\n",
    "* sys.getrefcount(my_var) -> passeing my_var to gerefcount() creates an extra reference\n",
    "* ctypes.c_long.from_address(address).value -> here we just pass the memory address (an integer (id(my_var)), not a reference - does not affect reference count)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Garbage collection\n",
    "* Circular references \n",
    "    * occur when a group of objects reference each other in a circular manner, forming a cycle. \n",
    "    * The reference counting mechanism alone cannot handle circular references because the reference counts of the objects involved never reach zero due to the circular nature.\n",
    "    * To address circular references, Python employs a garbage collection algorithm that includes a cycle detector. The cyclic garbage collector identifies and collects cycles of objects with no external references, allowing the memory to be freed even in the presence of circular dependencies.\n",
    "* Garbage collector:\n",
    "    * is a memory management process that identifies and collects objects that are no longer reachable or referenced in a program. It helps automatically reclaim memory occupied by these unreferenced objects, preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory usage in Python programs.\n",
    "    * can be controlled programmatically using gc module\n",
    "    * by default iit is turned on (takes some computing power)\n",
    "    * you may turn it off if you're sure your code does not create circular references - but beware!!\n",
    "    * runs periodically on its own (if turned on)\n",
    "    * you can call it manually, and even do your own cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic vs Static typing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Static languages (e.g. Java, C++, Swift) declare data type during data declaration\n",
    "* Python (dynamic language) does NOT have to declare data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable re-assignment\n",
    "\n",

    "    * the content of lists in the tuple can be changed\n",
    "    * The object rerferences in the tuple did not change, but the referenced objects did mutate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutability methods can affect the memory address.\n",
    "    * e.g. Appending to a list with a append method does not change the address, while concatination does change the address\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Function arguments and mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Changing values of the variables in the functions follow the same rules of mutability and reference assignemnt\n",
    "* Attributes of the function reference to the same addresses as the variables passed to the function\n",
    "* Immutable objects are safe from unintended side-effects\n",
    "* Mutable objects are NOT safe from unintended side-effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared references and mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whenever you create two **immutable** variables with the same value, they share reference to one memory address\n",
    "    * This is safe, since changing the immutable variables will create a new memory address for a changed value\n",
    "* This does NOT work when variables are **mutable**\n",

    "* Any object can be passed to a function including functions\n",

    "### Python Optimizations: Interning\n",
    "* This program is using CPython, the standard (or reference) Python implementation (written in C)\n",
    "* Why\n",
    "    * when creating a = 6 and b = 6, both of the variables are referencing the same memory address  \n",
    "    but   \n",
    "    * when creating a = 500 and b = 500, these two variables reference two different memory addresses?\n",
    "* **Interning**: Reusing objects on-demand\n",
    "* At startup, Python (CPython), pre-loads (caches) a global list of integers in the range **[-5; 256]**\n",
    "    * Optimization strategy - small integers show up often\n",
    "* Any time an integer is referenced in that range, Python will use the cahced version of that object\n",
    "* Singletons = classes that can only be instantiated once\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Optimizations: String interning\n",
    "* Some strings are automatically interned - but not all!\n",
    "* As the Python code is compiled, identifiers (or the ones that look like identifiers) are interned\n",
    "    * start with \\_ or (a-z A-Z)\n",
    "    * consist of \\_, (a-z A-Z 0-9)\n",
    "    * i.e.: strings with white spaces will not get interned\n",
    "* NOt all strings are automatically interned by Python\n",
    "* But you can force strings to be interned by using the sys.intern() method\n",
    "    * In general though, you do not need to intern strings yourself. Only do this if you really need to.\n",
    "* It is much faster to compare the references to the addresses (with is / is not method) rather than character by character (with == / != method)  \n",
    "* Example 1:\n",
    "    * a = 'hello'\n",
    "    * b = 'hello'\n",
    "    * a is b -> True\n",
    "    * a == b -> True  \n",
